Basic stuff is working, now I just need to make the network actually learn

Why does it reach a generation with a high win rate against gen1 (~83%) and then immediately drop to ~50% next gen1 
    This occurs both at low generations and high generations


Win rate does not seem to be consistantly increasing, but is pretty random.
    We are usually not getting worse than the best gen1 player, but typically not much better in most cases.


Stuff to think about:
    are we mutating too much/ to strongly 
    are crossover and mutation methods actually producing effective offspring
        are there other ways to crossover and mutate which have a more subtle effective
            I am currently crossing over every weight. Should i have a random chance for a node to be crossovered? 


    should I be changing each weight, or only the input weights
    should there be only a single layer neural net

    choose fewer parents
        like 4 instead of half the population
        random chance to crossover each weight in this case
