Basic stuff is working, now I just need to make the network actually learn

Why does it reach a generation with a high win rate against gen1 (~83%) and then immediately drop to ~50% next gen1 
    This occurs both at low generations and high generations


Win rate does not seem to be consistantly increasing, but is pretty random.
    We are usually not getting worse than the best gen1 player, but typically not much better in most cases.
