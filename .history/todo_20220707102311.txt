#Create player class (card, money)

highCard game:
#    card comparison
#    betting
#    win conditions

    highCard might return the player which wins

    modes for #pvp, pvc, cvc

implement baseline strategy

implement neural net which dictates actions

implement tournament style match for bots to play eachother

Activation for currChips and opponent's chips:
    map ratio of currentChips/initialChips into .5x. 


Activation for currentBet:
    activation is just ratio of min(currentbet/currentChips, 1)


Stuff to think about:
    How do I handle the neural net wanting to do something that's illegal (raising when you don't have enough to call etc)

    How do I handle bet amounts for output
        What do I do if it wants to bet more than it has
    

big blind inflation:
    double big blind after x hands
    create logic if player has fewer chips than bigblind
